Description: Strategy Gaming Engine
 Stratagus is a free cross-platform real-time strategy gaming engine.
 It includes support for playing over Internet/LAN, or playing vs.
 computer opponents. The engine is configurable and can be used to
 create games with a wide-range of features specific to your needs.
 .
 Stratagus started as a clone of the realtime fantasy strategy game
 Warcraft II from Blizzard Entertainment, although it is used now as a
 game engine to build other games, sci-fi or fantasy ones.
 .
 Stratagus is developed together for Windows, Linux and Linux Maemo based
 devices (Nokia N900).
 .
