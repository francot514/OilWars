# - Try to detect some SDL gles support
# Once done this will define
#
#  SDLGLES_FOUND - system has gles support in SDL
#  SDLGLES_TYPE - Native, Maemo or EGL
#  SDLGLES_INCLUDE_DIR - include directory for SDL gles (can be empty)
#  SDLGLES_LIBRARY - library for SDL gles (can be empty)

# Types:
#  Native - support is in SDL, program only needs to add SDL_OPENGLES flag to SDL_SetVideoMode
#  Maemo - support using SDL_gles library which was created for Maemo but should work with other systems too
#          program needs to call SDL_GLES_Init, SDL_GLES_CreateContext and SDL_GLES_MakeCurrent
#          More info on https://garage.maemo.org/projects/sdlhildon and https://wiki.maemo.org/User:Javispedro/SDL-GLES
#  EGL - support using directly EGL library, see http://pandorawiki.org/Combining_OpenGL_ES_1.1_and_SDL_to_create_a_window_on_the_Pandora
#        program needs to initialize EGL and GLES manually
